How to upload file with Puppeteer (real case upload to easyupload.io)

## Preparation
I assume you already have NodeJS and npm installed on your machine.

Clone this code or fork (up to you)
```
git clone https://github.com/sonyarianto/upload-file-with-puppeteer.git
```
and go to repository folder.

Install Puppeteer
```
npm i puppeteer
```

## Run
Just type this on the repository folder.
```
node upload_file.js
```

This example will test the `elementHandle.uploadFile()` API. The real case scenario is we upload an image file `test_to_upload.jpg` to website called https://easyupload.io
